# Ametic's NixOS Dotfiles

This is my daily NixOS configuration, based on [ZaneyOS](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos).
I'm completely beginner in Nix so it can be messed up but i'm trying my best to make it work properly ;)
I'm also treating it as my learning journey, so you can look into commits and take what u need.

# How to use it:

All you need to do is just clone the repo, and install it by manual install provided [there](https://gitlab.com/Zaney/zaneyos).
Host name that i'm currently using on my main PC is called "desktop".

# Big thanks to:
